    location: "Kananaskis, AB",
    description: "During an intensive on-site program with SAIT, I lived in a remote camp while conducting an environmental assessment. I spent long hours in the beautiful area of the Kananaskis mountains, where I collected a variety of environmental samples. I analyzed river and soil health using multiparameter meters, in-situ sondes and invertebrate counts. I also assessed levels of heavy metals in the forest through an extensive experiment on lichen populations. Lastly, I observed wildlife biodiversity through deployment of trail cameras and eDNA studies.",

    description: "In the remote locations of the Ghost Watershed, many riverbanks are unstable and eroding because of off-road vehicles. I helped restore disturbed areas through removing debris, building natural drain trenches, planting native trees and willow staking.",

    description: "In collaboration with organizations such as Cows and Fish, AWES and Mountain View County, I assisted with restoring the riparian zone at a local farm. Cattle farmers face destruction to their home as cows will trample areas around a stream. By working alongside the farmers, cows were deterred and the riparian zone was restored through wattle fences and willow staking.",

    description: "As a CreekWatch volunteer, I monitor my local stream for water quality. I conduct weekly assessments with my team by gathering precise data on pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrient levels and more. I also collect and analyze invertebrate species, especially Mayflies, an important indicator species. These efforts provide essential information for long-term environmental trends.",

    location: "Calgary, AB",
    description: "As a seasonal gardener, my environmental skills were consistently put to the test while working in areas with dense vegetation, invasive species, and degraded soils. While managing a small team, my work involved restoring over 50+ botanical landscapes through site cleanup, planting, and transplanting a wide range of native vegetation. I also regularly rehabilitated soils to create suitable growing conditions for plants. My day-to-day work required physical endurance, time management and safe operation of trucks and tools, all while adapting to changing environmental conditions.",
