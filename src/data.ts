    location: "Kananaskis, AB",
    description: "During an intensive on-site program with SAIT, I lived in a remote camp while conducting an environmental assessment. I spent long hours in the beautiful area of the Kananaskis mountains, where I collected a variety of environmental samples. I analyzed river and soil health using multiparameter meters, in-situ sondes and invertebrate counts. I also assessed levels of heavy metals in the forest through an extensive experiment on lichen populations. Lastly, I observed wildlife biodiversity through deployment of trail cameras and eDNA studies.",

    description: "In collaboration with organizations such as Cows and Fish, AWES and Mountain View County, I assisted with restoring the riparian zone at a local farm. Cattle farmers face destruction to their home as cows will trample areas around a stream. By working alongside the farmers, cows were deterred and the riparian zone was restored through wattle fences and willow staking.",

    description: "As a CreekWatch volunteer, I monitor my local stream for water quality. I conduct weekly assessments with my team by gathering precise data on pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrient levels and more. I also collect and analyze invertebrate species, especially Mayflies, an important indicator species. These efforts provide essential information for long-term environmental trends.",
